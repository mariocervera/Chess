# Chess

This repository contains a Visual Studio 2015 project that implements a basic Chess game in C#. The game
provides some nice features, such as different skins, allowed movements highlight, a stopwatch for
each player, and a movements log. It also supports pawn promotion and displays warnings when the king
is in check. The application implements various design patterns, such as Memento, Singleton, and Iterator.

In order to execute the application, you can open the project using Visual Studio and execute it
within the IDE, or directly run the application by means of the executable file that is located
in the "bin" folder.
